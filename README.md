### Main problems:
 - Mine xcode didn't have "Tabblet app" on creation, so I managed to create simple app with StoryBoard
 - Why are we even creating an IOS app with IOS13 compatible in it?
 - Also used this [cool site](https://makeappicon.com/) to generate app icons form an image, so it would be cool to mention it next time
